# üç™ Cookies Playground

A simple playground project, where I explore and experiment with [HTTP Cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies).

![cookies playground preview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58401630/156927705-eb153ce3-41e1-41d8-b9cc-b621c0528bd3.png)

## Why?

In my [other project](https://github.com/sitek94/jwt-refresh-token-demo) I wanted to implement JWT authentication, 
with Refresh Token stored in HTTP only cookie. However, when I started working on that, I realized that I don't know
that much about cookies, not to mention HTTP only cookies üôä

## What?

- `/client` - simple React app, with visualization of cookies and ability to set them.
- `/server` - simple Express server, which allows us to see HTTP only cookies.

## How?

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sitek94/cookies-playground.git

# Install dependencies
cd cookies-playground
pnpm install

# Start the server
pnpm run start:server 

# Start the client
pnpm run start:client
```

### Server

The server is listening on port 3333:
[http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333)

### Client

The app is running on port 3000:
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

You can also test cookies on sub-paths: http://localhost:3000/some/sub-path

Cookies will be tested under this particular path (`/some/sub-path`).

## Test https and 3d party cookies with iframes

1. Edit your `/etc/hosts` or `C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts` file to link test hostnames to your local machine: 
```shell
127.0.0.1 back.third-party.playground
127.0.0.1 front.third-party.playground
127.0.0.1 www.top-level.playground
```
2. Make sure you have [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/docs/install) installed
3. Start Caddy
```shell
caddy run --config Caddyfile
```
4. Start server and client (see above)
5. Access the frontend via https://www.top-level.playground or https://www.top-level.playground/some/path

## Create React App

Client was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
